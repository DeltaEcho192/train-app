CheckBoxs filled and if not true then make pop up.
If user decides not to change anything ask for confirm
If checkbox made true again wipe out data added previously. (How to do with images? Probably easier todo with local server)
Delete Text in alert after close

Multiple image upload?
Display image in alertDialog after upload.


Image nameing convention with image picker... (Perhaps API would be better.)

Build Some basic api's for lists that need to be delivered 
(Specifically for getting all the required check marks for a program)


End of the day write comments on code!!!
